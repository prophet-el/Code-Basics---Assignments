#1. Create a variable called break and assign it a value 5. See what happens and find out the reason behind the behavior that you see.
#break = 5
#print(break) it is showing invalid syntax since you can not assign value to break since it is already a python keyword

#2. Create two variables. One to store your birth year and one to store current year. Now calculate your age using these two variables.

birth_year = 1995
cur_year = 2022
age = cur_year - birth_year
print(age)

#3. Store your first, middle and last name in three different variables and print your full name using these variables
first = "Saumay"
middle = "Subhash"
last = "Dhaundiyal"
print("My name is:", first + " " + middle + " " + last)

#4 Answer which of these are invalid variable names: "
_nation = 5
print(_nation)
#1record = 5 invalid
record1 = 10
print(record1)
record_one = 15
print(record_one)
#record-one = 20
#print(record-1) invalid
#record^one = 25
#print(record^one) invalid
#continue = 5 invalid
